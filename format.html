		<h2>Format: Details</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Presentation (50% of grade)</h3>

		<p>
			Every participant will make <b>two presentations</b> in the seminar series.
			In each presentation, the participant will perform a detailed study of one paper or a bundle of several papers. 
			If a bundle is chosen, the participant only needs to present <b>one of the papers in the bundle</b> according to their preference,
			but they are encouraged to discuss the connections between the papers in the bundle.
			The participant will present the main ideas of the papers in a presentation of
			approximately <b>25 minutes</b>, and it will often not be possible to discuss all results presented therein. Work on the topic
			usually requires reading and understanding the papers, as well as acquiring background information necessary
			to understand the topic. For extra background knowledge, some of the papers and books referenced in the
			papers may have to be consulted. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you use formulas, make sure that all symbols are introduced properly. Similarly, make sure that figures
			are labelled correctly and that new terminology is introduced appropriately. You may assume that your
			audience is familiar with topics that have been presented in class earlier, and have read the papers for
			your week. It is very important for a good presentation to find a balance between overview and detail. Most
			importantly, the general theme of your topic should become clear from your presentation. Your goal is that
			the other participants will have understood your critical analysis of the two papers after your
			presentation. Finally, prepare your presentation on time and plan to spend some time on practicing your
			talk. Our feedback afterwards will help you improve future presentations.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please select and register for the two (bundles of) papers you would like to present in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QOHiwTcZ5eh1SqT6SdEBZqUJe_z9TehR4b5NBUeRAZ8/edit?usp=sharing">
				<b>this Google Docs</b></a>. 
			Ensure you are fully prepared <b>one class before your scheduled class for presentation</b>.
			Upload your slides to  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OIKCn562KA3sPUGh-9x8mFuqazU92Cyk?usp=sharing">
				<b>this Google Folder</b>
			</a><b> at least one hour before the class prior to your assigned class for presentation</b>.
			This is important in case of an emergency requiring us to reschedule your talk.
			For example, if you’re presenting on Monday, upload your slides by the previous Wednesday at 2:30 PM.
			If presenting on Wednesday, upload by the previous Monday at 2:30 PM.
		</p>

		<p>
			The grading criteria for the presentation are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Form (30%):</b> Time / Verbal speed & clarity / Body posture / Engagement with audience </li>
				<li><b>Content (50%):</b> Structure or storyline / Main points / Paper connections / Valid conclusions </li>
				<li><b>Answers (20%):</b> Good answers to questions / Knowledgeable </li>
			</ul>	
		</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Discussion (25% of grade across weeks)</h3>

		<p>
			The presentation will be followed by a discussion among the seminar participants. This discussion will be
			chaired by the discussion leader, who will be one of the participants. Before the presentation, one
			participant will be chosen at random to be the discussion leader. Their job is to direct discussion such
			that the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques and of the field are discussed, that open questions and
			future directions of the work are discussed, and that questions of other participants are fielded.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before each class, every participant will submit <b>two questions (one question per paper/bundle)</b> that they would like
			answered on the upcoming class's papers. These questions will be submitted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QOHiwTcZ5eh1SqT6SdEBZqUJe_z9TehR4b5NBUeRAZ8/edit?usp=sharing">
				<b>this Google Form</b>
			</a> before the seminar. 
			The questions will be given to the discussion leader, and it is their job to integrate them into the discussion. For
			participants, these questions act as evidence of participation, and your overall participation score will be
			based on the quality of your questions and your involvement in the discussion.
		</p>

		<p>
			Participants are expected to <b>read every paper</b> in preparation for the upcoming presentations.
			Initially, we will teach you how to read an academic paper, and each week at least one expert member of
			staff will be available to answer questions. We expect students to actively engage in discussions for
			further understanding of the presented material. We aim for a creative atmosphere – ideas developed during
			the seminar work might lead to Masters thesis projects.
		</p>

		<p>
			The grading criteria for the discussion are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Moderation (30%):</b> Integrates questions well / Pushes forward discussion / Good summary / Strengths and weaknesses of paper </li>
				<li><b>Questions (70%):</b> The questions submmited before the class (two per class). Graded by completion </li>
			</ul>	
		</p>
		
		<h3>Part 3: Other Activity Participation (25% of grade)</h3>

		<p>
			In addition to the in-class presentation and discussion, we will have three special lectures at the end of the semester. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the practice lecture, we will introduce and demonstrate wonderful tools (e.g. Nerfstudio) for you, 
			and you are welcome to try them to create your own neural scene representation and neural rendering results at or after the class. <br/>
			In the followed lecture, we will have a discussion on favorite papers. Each participant has 5 minutes to present their favorite paper. <br/>
			In the last lecture, we will have a summary of the seminar series and a brainstorming session for future research ideas.
		</p>

		<p>
			The grading criteria for the special lectures are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Practice Lecture (30%):</b> Attentively listening / Engagement of coding</li>
				<li><b>Discussion on your favourite papers (35%):</b> Clear presentation and explanation </li>
				<li><b>Brainstorming (35%):</b> Contribution of ideas / Active participation </li>
			</ul>	
		</p>

		<!-- <h3>Part 3: Written report (40% of grade)</h3>

		<p>
			In addition to the in-class presentation, we require a written report on the chosen topic. This report
			should summarize the main ideas of the accompanying papers and critically analyze limitations of the works.
			In addition, participants should develop and sketch their own idea of how to address one specific
			shortcoming. The report should consist of 1-2 pages covering the presented papers and about 1-2 pages
			covering the improvement proposed by the student.
		</p>

		<p>
			The written report uses a template of a major computer vision conference, the <a
				href="https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/">IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>.
			Please use the review version of this template, as this makes it easier to refer to certain parts of your
			text. For your convenience we provide the <a
				href="https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/cvpr2022-author_kit-v1_1-1.zip">template
				links here</a>. The submission format has to be PDF, and the use of LaTeX is strongly encouraged.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will grade your report based on a number of criteria. Try to avoid copying the
			structure of the original papers, do not stick too closely to the original text, and use your imagination to
			find a way of presenting the topic in your own words. Equations can of course be reproduced. The articles
			have been chosen such that they provide different views on a common theme – you should focus on finding
			connections in concepts and to look through the ‘academic apparatus’ of the writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep in mind to structure your paper formally: An abstract provides a short overview. The introduction
			expands on that, explains why the problem is unsolved/hard, and motivates the use of the technique. In a
			technical section, you present your topic and the details that are of interest to you. Here you can also
			expand on the subject, i.e., add your own ideas. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the paper. This is also
			the place where you can add your own opinions about the topic.
		</p>

		<p>
			We encourage you to use additional literature in the development of your own ideas. We expect at least 1-2
			additional references; if you want to include more, you are welcome to do so. Cite the references
			appropriately, for example if you use concepts from different publications or if you want to link to
			additional information. Use these other references to create a ‘big picture’ of the field.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your own ideas can be developed from scratch – if you have a great idea, try to sketch it and a possible
			solution. The report is also an excellent opportunity to take some of the discussion from the seminar
			sessions and integrate the gained context and ideas. You can also discuss limitations or ideas that you feel
			are missing from the papers. A further possibility is to research recent developments following the papers
			of your topic. If you pursue this route, you could base your “own ideas” section on several follow-up
			publications, but make sure that you do not simply copy parts of other papers! A good resource for free
			links to research articles is <a href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>. The “cited by” option
			often links to useful related work. Another source of freely available scientific articles is <a
				href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">Citeseer</a>. If you can only find a link behind a paywall, send us
			an email and we will try to get you a copy.
